## 📌 Overview

BookStore is a fully serverless e-commerce application designed and deployed on AWS. Built as part of an internship project, it demonstrates real-world cloud engineering — including microservices architecture, JWT-based authentication, role-based access control, and Infrastructure as Code using Terraform.

The application allows customers to browse books, manage a cart, and place orders — while admins can manage the product catalog through protected APIs.

## 🔄 Application Workflow

1. User visits the app — CloudFront serves assets from **S3**
2. User signs up or logs in — **Auth Service** validates and returns a **JWT token**
3. Frontend attaches the JWT to subsequent requests
4. **API Gateway** routes requests to the correct **Lambda microservice**
5. Lambda functions execute business logic and read/write from **DynamoDB**
6. Responses are returned to the frontend
7. Admin users access protected product management APIs via role-based authorization

## 🚀 Deployment

### Infrastructure (Terraform)
```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### Backend (AWS Lambda + API Gateway + DynamoDB)
Deployed automatically via Terraform. Lambda functions are packaged and deployed per microservice.

### Frontend (S3 + CloudFront)
Static assets are uploaded to S3 and served globally through CloudFront CDN.

## 🧪 Testing

Unit tests are written using **Pytest**.

```bash
py -m pytest -v
```

## 🛠️ Key Technical Challenges Solved

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| API Gateway Routing | Configured path-based routing to Lambda microservices |
| DynamoDB Data Modeling | Designed partition keys and attribute structures per table |
| CORS Configuration | Enabled cross-origin headers on API Gateway and Lambda responses |
| CloudFront Cache Invalidation | Managed invalidations on frontend deployments |
| JWT Authentication | Implemented token generation, signing, and validation in auth service |
| Role-Based Authorization | Decoded JWT claims to enforce admin vs. customer access |
